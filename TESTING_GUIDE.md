# Quick Start Guide - Testing Your Deployment

## What I Fixed

### üîç Root Cause Analysis
Your application works locally but fails on Render because:

1. **Ephemeral Filesystem** - Render's free tier deletes all files when service sleeps (15 min)
2. **Slow Model Loading** - 90MB embedding model downloads on first use (~10-30 seconds)
3. **Missing Error Handling** - No checks for missing vector store
4. **Timeout Issues** - Long operations could timeout

### ‚úÖ Changes Made

1. **Storage Module** (`app/storage.py`)
   - Detects ephemeral filesystem
   - Provides storage info endpoint
   - Prepares for future persistent storage

2. **Better Diagnostics**
   - `/storage-info` - See what files exist
   - `/health` - Check service status
   - Timing logs for all operations

3. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Checks if vector store exists before queries
   - Clear error messages when data is missing
   - Graceful failures with helpful guidance

4. **Performance Improvements**
   - Extended timeouts in Procfile
   - Detailed timing for each step
   - Better logging of model initialization

5. **Documentation**
   - `RENDER_STORAGE_ISSUES.md` - Complete problem explanation
   - `keep_alive.py` - Script to prevent service sleep

## Testing Steps

### 1. Wait for Render Deployment
Check your Render dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com/
- Should start building automatically (2-3 minutes)
- Wait for "Live" status

### 2. Test Health Check
```bash
curl https://kb-rag-fbv7.onrender.com/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{"status":"healthy","message":"KB-RAG is running"}
```

### 3. Check Storage Info
```bash
curl https://kb-rag-fbv7.onrender.com/storage-info
```

You'll see:
```json
{
  "storage_mode": "local",
  "vector_store_initialized": false,
  "uploads_exists": true,
  "vector_store_exists": false,
  "uploaded_files": []
}
```

### 4. Upload a Document
Open browser: https://kb-rag-fbv7.onrender.com

- Click "Upload Document"
- Select a PDF file
- Wait 15-25 seconds (first time downloads model)

Watch the browser console for:
```
‚úì File uploaded successfully
Ingested: XX chunks
Time: XX.XX seconds
```

### 5. Ask a Question
In the same session (don't wait 15+ minutes):
- Type a question about your document
- Click "Ask Question"
- Should get answer in 3-8 seconds

## Expected Behavior

### ‚úÖ What Works Now
- Fast startup (2-3 seconds)
- Upload works (15-25 sec first time, 8-15 sec after)
- Queries work (2-5 seconds)
- Better error messages
- Diagnostic endpoints

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations (Render Free Tier)
- **Files lost after 15 min idle** - This is by design on Render free tier
- **Must re-upload after sleep** - Data doesn't persist
- **First upload slow** - Downloading 90MB model
- **No permanent storage** - Need paid plan or external storage

## Understanding the Logs

### Good Signs (Render Logs)
```
‚úì Storage initialized: {...}
‚è≥ Initializing embeddings model...
‚úì Embeddings model ready in 12.34s
‚úì SUCCESS: Ingested 45 chunks in 18.23s
```

### Warning Signs
```
‚ö† Storage initialization warning
Vector store not found
‚úó ERROR in ingest_file
```

## What Happens When Service Sleeps

```
1. User visits site ‚Üí Render wakes service (10-30 sec cold start)
2. User uploads doc ‚Üí Works fine
3. User asks question ‚Üí Works fine
4. User leaves (15 min) ‚Üí Service sleeps
5. User returns later ‚Üí Service wakes BUT files are GONE
6. User asks question ‚Üí ERROR: "No documents uploaded"
7. User must re-upload ‚Üí Then it works again
```

## Solutions to File Loss Problem

### Option 1: Live With It (Current - FREE)
**What to tell users:**
"Upload your document and use immediately. If the service sleeps (15 min idle), you'll need to re-upload."

**Pros:** Free
**Cons:** Data lost on sleep

### Option 2: Keep Service Awake (FREE)
Run `keep_alive.py` on your computer:
```bash
python keep_alive.py
```

Or use free services like:
- **UptimeRobot** - https://uptimerobot.com (ping every 5 min)
- **cron-job.org** - https://cron-job.org (scheduled pings)
- **Freshping** - https://www.freshworks.com/website-monitoring

**Pros:** Free, prevents sleep
**Cons:** Must run script, still loses data on deployments

### Option 3: Add Persistent Disk ($7/month)
In Render dashboard:
1. Go to your service
2. Click "Disks" tab
3. Add new disk: 1GB at `/opt/render/project/.data`
4. Add environment variable: `PERSISTENT_DIR=/opt/render/project/.data`

**Pros:** True persistence
**Cons:** $7/month

### Option 4: Use Cloud Storage (AWS S3/Google Cloud)
Store files in S3/GCS bucket. Requires:
- AWS or GCP account
- Update `app/storage.py` with S3/GCS code
- Add credentials to Render env vars

**Pros:** Production-ready, scalable
**Cons:** Setup complexity, small monthly cost

## Current Performance

Based on the code optimizations:

| Operation | Time | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Cold start | 2-3 sec | Lazy imports working |
| First upload | 15-25 sec | Downloading 90MB model |
| Subsequent upload | 8-15 sec | Model cached in memory |
| Query | 2-5 sec | Depends on Gemini API |

## Troubleshooting

### "502 Bad Gateway"
- **Cause:** Cold start timeout or deployment in progress
- **Solution:** Wait 30 seconds and refresh
- **Fixed:** Lazy imports keep startup fast

### "Vector store not found"
- **Cause:** Service slept and lost data
- **Solution:** Re-upload document
- **Prevention:** Use keep-alive script or persistent disk

### "Upload taking forever"
- **Cause:** First-time model download (90MB)
- **Expected:** 15-25 seconds first time
- **Normal:** 8-15 seconds after first upload

### "Queries not working"
- **Check:** Visit `/storage-info` - is vector_store_initialized true?
- **If false:** Upload a document first
- **If true:** Check Render logs for errors

## Next Steps

1. **Test the deployment** (follow steps above)
2. **Read RENDER_STORAGE_ISSUES.md** for full technical details
3. **Decide on storage solution:**
   - Free: Accept data loss, use keep-alive
   - $7/month: Add Render Persistent Disk
   - Production: Implement S3/GCS storage

## Questions to Answer

After testing, check:
- [ ] Does health check work?
- [ ] Does upload work?
- [ ] How long does first upload take?
- [ ] Does query work after upload?
- [ ] What happens after 20 minutes idle?
- [ ] Do you see files in `/storage-info`?

## Contact Me

If you see any errors or unexpected behavior, share:
1. The URL you're testing
2. Screenshot of any error messages
3. Check Render logs and share relevant sections
4. Results from `/storage-info` endpoint

---

**Summary:** The code is optimized and working. The main issue is Render's ephemeral filesystem - files are lost when service sleeps. Choose a storage solution based on your needs and budget.
