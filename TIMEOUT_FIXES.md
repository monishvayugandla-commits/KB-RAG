# üîß Timeout Issues Fixed

## Problem Analysis

From the Render logs and user testing, we identified **upload timeout issues** on cold starts.

### Root Cause

**Frontend timeout (90s) was too short for cold start operations:**

1. **Cold Start Sequence:**
   - Service spins up: ~10-15s
   - Model download (sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2): 40-60s
   - Document processing: 20-40s
   - **Total: 70-115 seconds**

2. **Result:** Frontend was aborting requests before backend completed processing

### The Error Message

```
‚ùå Upload timeout (>90s). Server may be cold starting. Try again in 30 seconds.
```

This was appearing because the 90-second timeout was exceeded during model download.

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### 1. Frontend Timeouts Extended

**File:** `static/js/app.js`

| Operation | Old Timeout | New Timeout | Reason |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| Upload | 90s | **180s** | Cold start + model download + processing |
| Query | 60s | **120s** | Gemini API can be slow on complex queries |

**Changes:**
```javascript
// Upload timeout: 90s ‚Üí 180s (3 minutes)
const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 180000);

// Query timeout: 60s ‚Üí 120s (2 minutes)
const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 120000);
```

### 2. Backend Timeout Extended

**File:** `Procfile`

```bash
# Old
--timeout-keep-alive 120

# New
--timeout-keep-alive 180
```

This ensures the backend doesn't kill connections before the frontend times out.

### 3. Improved User Messaging

**File:** `static/js/app.js`

```javascript
// More accurate timing information
statusDiv.innerHTML = '‚è≥ Uploading... First upload may take 60-120 seconds (model download + processing)';
```

### 4. Health Check Enhanced

**File:** `app/main.py`

Now the `/health` endpoint returns:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "message": "KB-RAG is running",
  "api_key_configured": true,
  "upload_dir": "/tmp/uploads",
  "vector_store_dir": "/tmp/vector_store/faiss_index"
}
```

This helps debug configuration issues.

### 5. Startup Timing Information

**File:** `app/main.py`

Added clear timing expectations in logs:
```
‚è±Ô∏è  IMPORTANT TIMING INFORMATION:
‚Ä¢ First upload (cold start): 60-120 seconds
  - Model download: 40-60s
  - Document processing: 20-40s
‚Ä¢ Subsequent uploads: 8-15 seconds (model cached)
‚Ä¢ Queries: 3-8 seconds
```

### 6. Cache-Busting Updated

**File:** `templates/app.html`

```html
<!-- Old -->
<script src="/static/js/app.js?v=2.0"></script>

<!-- New -->
<script src="/static/js/app.js?v=3.0"></script>
```

Ensures browsers load the new timeout values.

## üìä Expected Behavior After Fix

### First Upload (Cold Start)
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Time:** 60-120 seconds
- üì• **Model Download:** Happens automatically
- ‚úÖ **Status:** Should complete successfully
- üí° **Note:** This only happens once per deployment

### Subsequent Uploads (Warm)
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Time:** 8-15 seconds
- üì¶ **Model:** Cached in memory
- ‚úÖ **Status:** Fast and reliable
- üí° **Note:** As long as service stays warm

### Queries
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Time:** 3-8 seconds
- ü§ñ **AI:** Gemini generates answers
- ‚úÖ **Status:** Consistent performance

---

## üß™ Testing After Deployment

### 1. Check Health Endpoint
```bash
curl https://kb-rag-fbv7.onrender.com/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "message": "KB-RAG is running",
  "api_key_configured": true,
  "upload_dir": "/tmp/uploads",
  "vector_store_dir": "/tmp/vector_store/faiss_index"
}
```

### 2. Test Upload (Be Patient!)
1. Go to: https://kb-rag-fbv7.onrender.com/app
2. Upload a PDF document
3. **Wait 60-120 seconds on first upload**
4. Should see: ‚úÖ Successfully ingested X chunks!

### 3. Test Query
1. Ask a question about your document
2. Should get an AI-generated answer in 3-8 seconds

## üéØ Success Criteria

After these fixes, you should see:

‚úÖ **No more "Upload timeout" errors** (unless >180s)  
‚úÖ **First upload completes successfully** (60-120s)  
‚úÖ **Subsequent uploads are fast** (8-15s)  
‚úÖ **Queries work reliably** (3-8s)  
‚úÖ **Health check shows API key configured**

## üìù Summary of Changes

| File | Change | Impact |
|------|--------|--------|
| `static/js/app.js` | Upload timeout: 90s ‚Üí 180s | Handles cold starts |
| `static/js/app.js` | Query timeout: 60s ‚Üí 120s | Handles slow Gemini responses |
| `Procfile` | Backend timeout: 120s ‚Üí 180s | Matches frontend |
| `app/main.py` | Enhanced health check | Better debugging |
| `app/main.py` | Added timing info to logs | User expectations |
| `templates/app.html` | Cache-bust v2.0 ‚Üí v3.0 | Forces browser reload |

---

## üöÄ Deployment

All changes are committed and will deploy automatically to Render.

**Expected deployment time:** 2-3 minutes

After deployment:
1. Wait for "Your service is live üéâ" in Render logs
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Test upload with a small PDF (be patient on first upload!)
4. Test query after successful upload

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **First upload after deployment IS SLOW** (60-120s) - this is normal
2. **Service goes to sleep after 15 min idle** - first request after wake is slow
3. **Files are deleted when service sleeps** - need to re-upload after idle
4. **Browser cache:** Always force-refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) after deployment

---

## üí° Why These Timeouts?

| Timeout | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| 180s upload | Cold start (15s) + model download (60s) + processing (40s) + buffer (65s) |
| 120s query | Gemini API (8s) + retrieval (2s) + network (2s) + buffer (108s) |
| 180s backend | Must be ‚â• longest frontend timeout |

These are **conservative values** that ensure reliability even under worst-case scenarios.
